# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on the area of the house using a **Linear Regression** machine learning model.

It is a beginner-friendly end-to-end ML project developed using **Python**, executed in **VS Code**, and hosted on **GitHub**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
To build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house based on its area (in square feet).

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains two columns:
- **Area** – Size of the house (in sq.ft)
- **Price** – Price of the house

Sample data:
Area: 500 → Price: 100000
Area: 1000 → Price: 200000

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
- GitHub

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the folder in VS Code
3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Train the model:python model/train_model.py
5. Run the application:python app.py


---

## ✅ Output
The model predicts the house price based on user input area.

Example:
Enter house area: 1200
Predicted Price: 240000


---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add train-test split and model evaluation
- Add data visualization
- Deploy using Streamlit
- Use real-world dataset

---

## 🌐 Streamlit Web Application
The project is also implemented as a web application using **Streamlit**.

Users can enter the house area in square feet and get the predicted price instantly through a browser interface.

To run the Streamlit app:streamlit run streamlit_app.py
